# Task Management System (PSS)

## Overview

Briefly introduce the project, mentioning that it's a task management system called PSS (Personal Schedule System). Provide a high-level overview of what the system does and its main features.

## Requirements and Design

### Understanding Requirements

- Review the provided requirements thoroughly.
- Understand the functionalities and features expected from the system.

### Designing Classes

- Identify the classes needed for the system based on the requirements.
- Design the class structures, their attributes, and methods.

## Task Class Hierarchy

### Base Classes

- Create base classes for `Task`, `RecurringTask`, `TransientTask`, and `AntiTask`.
- Define common attributes and methods in the base `Task` class.

### Subclasses

- Implement specific functionalities and attributes for each task type in their respective subclasses.

## PSS Class Implementation

- Create a class named `PSSController` to manage the task scheduling system.
- Implement methods for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks.
- Include methods for reading and writing schedules to files in JSON format.

## Validation and Error Handling

- Implement validation checks to ensure the correctness of task attributes.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to the user.

## Task Management Operations

- Implement methods for searching tasks by name.
- Handle recurring tasks, transient tasks, and anti-tasks interactions.
- Ensure tasks do not overlap and handle conflicts appropriately.

## User Interface (Optional)

- Develop a user interface (CLI or GUI) for interacting with the system.
- Implement user-friendly prompts and menus for task management operations.

## Testing

- Develop test cases covering various scenarios mentioned in the requirements.
- Verify that the system behaves as expected under different conditions.
- Test edge cases, invalid inputs, and error handling mechanisms.

## Documentation and Comments

- Document the code thoroughly, including class definitions, method signatures, and usage instructions.
- Add comments within the code to explain complex logic or algorithms.

## Code Review and Refactoring

- Conduct code reviews within the team to ensure code quality and consistency.
- Refactor code to improve readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards.

## Integration and Finalization

- Integrate individual components developed by team members.
- Conduct integration testing to ensure seamless interaction between modules.
- Finalize the project by addressing any remaining issues and polishing the user experience.
